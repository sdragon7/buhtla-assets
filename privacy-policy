Last Updated: December 2025

1. Introduction Welcome to Gocina Buhtla. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.


2. Data We Collect: 
Account Data: We collect your email address, encrypted password, username. You may also voluntarily provide your Instagram username as a text entry to be displayed on your profile. This is entirely optional and not required to use the App.

Authentication Data: We use Google Sign-In and Supabase Auth to facilitate account creation, which provides us with your name and email.

User-Generated Content: Images you upload for the "Buhtla Meseca" campaign.

Activity Data: Game results, coins earned, titles, rewards, and "Pekarski dan" progress.

Device Information: Through expo-device, we collect device model and OS version for performance optimization.

Push Notifications: We use Firebase Cloud Messaging and Expo Notifications, which require a unique push token from your device.

Media Files: We request access to your photo library or camera via expo-image-picker only for campaign participations.


3. Content Visibility and Moderation (The "Safety" Section)

Content Visibility: Images uploaded for campaigns are stored securely. These images are not visible to other users by default. Only entries selected by the administrator as finalists or winners will be displayed.

Content Moderation: All uploaded content is subject to review by the administrator. We reserve the right to remove any content that is offensive, inappropriate, or violates our community standards.

User Safety: Since content is moderated before being made public, there is no direct public feed of unvetted user content. If you encounter any issues, you can contact us directly via email.

Provide core app features (games, rewards, campaigns).

Manage your account and security.

Display your username and content (e.g., photos) on leaderboards or finalist galleries.

Send technical notices and push notification updates.


5. Data Sharing and Third Parties We do not sell your personal data. We use the following providers:

Google/Firebase: Authentication and push notification delivery.

Expo: Application infrastructure and updates.


6. Data Retention and Deletion We retain your data as long as your account is active. You can delete your account permanently through the profile settings within the app. Upon deletion, all personal data will be removed from our active databases.
